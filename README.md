# Piano_tiles_script
This is my first project that I have uploaded to GitHub.

I have not created the entire code. Original code was stolen from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRAIUA-Oc1Y

The code is janky and I could not care less honestly. I may improve the speed / efficiency in the future. 

The maximum score you can get with this script is around 120 points. 

Since the script is scanning only a single pixle and than clicking said single pixle, the tiles are capable of moving past it.
